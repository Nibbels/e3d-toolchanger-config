; To use the macro you need two z probes.
; Probe 0 (K0) is the original probe for Z-home. That is the microswitch at the tool head.
; Probe 1 (K1) is a button that is pressed down by the nozzle. I did mount it at the print bed. And attached it to the port "e1 endstop".
; The detailed logic, coordinate of the nozzle probe button and some safety rules are defined in deployprobe1.g and retractprobe1.g
